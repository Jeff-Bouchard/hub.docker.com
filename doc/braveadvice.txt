Here’s what’s needed to decentralize each OSI layer, and where your model could innovate:

1. Physical Layer (Layer 1)
Decentralization Aspect: Hardware diversity (WiFi, LoRa, Ethernet, satellite).
Challenge: No central authority controls transmission media.
Your Role: Hyperplexing can abstract physical heterogeneity—EmerDNS doesn’t operate here, but your model can dynamically select optimal physical paths based on availability.

2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
Protocols: Ethernet, PPP, Wi-Fi MAC.
Decentralization: Use distributed MAC protocols or blockchain-managed channel access (e.g., in wireless mesh networks).
Innovation: Enable trustless node authentication at L2 using decentralized identities (DID) tied to EmerDNS.
3. Network Layer (Layer 3)
Protocols: IP, ICMP.
Decentralization: Replace static IP routing with EmerDNS-driven name-based routing.
Example: Instead of IP addresses, use .emc names resolved to dynamic node identifiers across meshes.
Tools: Integrate with libp2p or cjdns for encrypted, self-routing networks.

4. Transport Layer (Layer 4)
Protocols: TCP, UDP.
Decentralization: Use reliable datagram services over UDP (e.g., QUIC) in P2P contexts.
Hyperplexing Angle: Aggregate streams across multiple transport instances (e.g., simultaneous UDP + WebRTC) under one logical session tied to an EmerDNS identity.
5. Session Layer (Layer 5)
Function: Manage sessions.
Decentralization: Replace NetBIOS/RPC with blockchain-signed session tokens.
Your Edge: Use EmerDNS to bind session lifecycle to a decentralized identity—enabling persistent, portable sessions across devices and networks.
6. Presentation Layer (Layer 6)
Function: Encryption, compression, translation.
Decentralization: Use end-to-end encryption (E2EE) with keys derived from EmerDNS records.
Innovation: Store public keys in EmerDNS TXT records, enabling automatic, trustless key discovery.

7. Application Layer (Layer 7)
Protocols: HTTP, SMTP, DNS.
Already Decentralized: With EmerDNS replacing traditional DNS, and DApps using P2P messaging (e.g., Whisper, Waku).
Hyperplexing Integration: One EmerDNS name can resolve to multiple services across different mesh networks, with hyperplexing routing context-aware traffic (e.g., video → high-bandwidth mesh, chat → low-latency mesh).
